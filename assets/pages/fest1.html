                <p>The RHS Chelsea Flower Show is a popular flower festival that is held every year in late May. Held at
                    the Royal Chelsea Hospital grounds, the festival lasts for 5 days with a variety of activity and
                    events happening during the daytime.
                    There is a sell-off during the last day in which attendees have the chance to purchase their dream
                    flower or flowers that suit their back garden.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Members who are part of the RHS have two days of early access to visit the show. This allow them to
                    view the displays before the public and in an uncrowded environment. In fact, it is useful for those
                    who wish to see the gardens but have a packed schedule.
                    There are a variety of flowers available with some of them used to create beautiful displays. These
                    displays are sometimes sold to the public on the final day for the public to use them personally.

                    Given that this is the first time you have heard of them, you might think that it has been around
                    for a number of years. Actually, it has been around for decades. We will show you why many
                    generations have visited the show.

                <p>The show was held at the hospital grounds since 1913, but its origins is much deeper. It was first
                    held at Chiswick in 1833 but moved to Kensington in 1863 in a bid to improve visiting numbers and
                    provide better transportation.
                    It ran under the name "The Royal Horticultural Society Great Spring Show". After hosting there for
                    26 years, The Great Show moved to London where Temple Gardens was chosen as the next location.
                    Eventually, it became a sucess after requisitioning three marquees from the former site. But one
                    critical show shaped the future of the festival as a whole.</p>

                <p>In 1912, the Royal International Horticultural Exhinition took place at the Royal Hospital in
                    Chelsea. The site proved to be suitable for shows like the aforementioned and the Great Spring Show
                    moved there from 1913 onwards. As time passed by, the show gradually increased in popularity. In
                    fact, it became so popular that overcrowding issues arose.
                    Despite the issues, the show continues to become a place for many independent and commercial firms
                    to showcase their designs.</p>

                    the Royal Family, such as Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles III, and Catherine, Princess of Wales.
                    The image and formality of the shows meant that it has been synonymous among the rich. After all,
                    the displays shown is treated as a form of art.
                    To provide motivation to the firms and continue increase the number of visitors, awards were
                    introduced wich each category being nominated for at least one award. There are also special awards
                    given to unique and creative designs, displays, or art.</p>
