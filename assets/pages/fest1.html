        <h2>Chelsea Flower Show</h2>
        <section class="container fest">
            <p>The <strong>RHS Chelsea Flower Show</strong> is a <em>popular</em> flower festival that is held every
                year in late May. Held at
                the <strong>Royal Chelsea Hospital</strong> grounds, the festival lasts for 5 days with a
                <em>variety</em> of activities and
                events happening during the daytime.
                There is a sell-off during the last day in which attendees have the chance to purchase their dream
                flower or flowers that suit their back garden.
                <br><br>
                Members who are part of the RHS have two days of early access to visit the show. This allow them to
                view the displays before the public and in an uncrowded environment. In fact, it is useful for those
                who wish to see the gardens but have a packed schedule.
                There are a <strong>variety of flowers</strong> available with some of them used to create beautiful
                displays. These
                displays are sometimes sold to the public on the final day for the public to use them personally.
                <br><br>
                Given that this is the first time you have heard of them, you might think that it has been around
                for a number of years. Actually, it has been around for decades. We will show you why many
                generations have visited the show.

                <p>The show was held at the hospital grounds since <strong>1913</strong>, but its origins is much
                    <em>deeper</em>. It was first
                    held at <strong>Chiswick</strong> in <strong>1833</strong> but moved to <strong>Kensington</strong>
                    in <strong>1863</strong> in a bid to <strong>improve visiting numbers</strong> and
                    <strong>provide better transportation</strong>.
                    It ran under the name <strong>"The Royal Horticultural Society Great Spring Show"</strong>. After
                    hosting there for
                    26 years, The Great Show moved to <strong>London</strong> where <strong>Temple Gardens</strong> was
                    chosen as the next location.
                    Eventually, it became a <em>success</em> after requisitioning three marquees from the former site.
                    But one
                    critical show shaped the future of the festival as a whole.
                    <br><br>
                    In <strong>1912</strong>, the <strong>Royal International Horticultural Exhibition</strong> took
                    place at the Royal Hospital in
                    Chelsea. The site proved to be suitable for shows like the aforementioned and the Great Spring Show
                    moved there from <strong>1913</strong> onwards. As time passed by, the show <em>gradually</em>
                    increased in popularity. In
                    fact, it became so popular that overcrowding issues arose.
                    Despite the issues, the show continues to become a place for many independent and commercial firms
                    to showcase their designs.

        <section class="container fest">
            <p>Throughout the years, the Chelsea Flower Show has seen many familiar visitors, including those from
                the <strong>Royal Family</strong>, such as Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles III, and Catherine,
                Princess of Wales.
                The image and <em>formality</em> of the shows meant that it has been synonymous among the rich.
                After all,
                the displays shown is treated as a form of art.
                To provide motivation to the firms and continue increase the number of visitors, awards were
                introduced wich each category being nominated for at least one award. There are also special awards
                given to <em>unique</em> and creative designs, displays, or art.
                <br><br>
                As well as that, there have been significant exhibit to help attract modern visitors and stary
                relevant. Today, the show sees 157,000 visitors every year and continues to expand its awards and
                gardens. It is a festival that is enjoyable, if you like flowers and art, and that continues to
                become inovative.
