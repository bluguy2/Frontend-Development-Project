		<h2>Canadian Tulip Festival</h2>
		<section class="container fest">
			<p>Located in <strong>Ottawa</strong> in the provence of <strong>Ontario, Canada</strong>, the
				<strong>Canadian Tulip Festival</strong> is claimed to be
				the world's largest tulip festival.
				Just like the Chelsea Flower Show, it is held <em>annually</em> in May and attracts <strong>650,000
					visitors</strong>. The
				festival lasts for 2 days, leading up to an important Victoria Day.
				<strong>Tulips</strong> are seen throughout Ottawa with the largest display seen in
				<strong>Commissioners Park</strong>. The admission
				is free of charge and there are many events held to atrract many generations.
				<br>
				In addition, the festival is organised as a non-profit charity under the name, <strong>"The Canadian
					Tulip
					Legacy"</strong>. It uses the money to continue supporting the festival and help others be educated
				about the
				tulips.
				The festival also has a cultural and historical aspect which makes it more <em>unique</em> than any
				other
				festival in the world. Its relationship with the <strong>Netherlands</strong> has helped create its
				existence but the
				story is quite interesting.
				In the next section, you will find out the origins of the festival and how the Netherlands continues
				to provide support to the festival.

				<p><strong>Seymour Cobley</strong> first donated <strong>83,000 tulips</strong> to Canada during the
					Second World War for their
					contribution. However, it was the Dutch family who donated 100,000 tulips to the Canadians after the
					war for protecting them from Nazi Germany.
					The contribution would eventually have a <em>huge</em> impact as the first Canadian Tulip Festival
					was
					organised by the <strong>Ottawa Board of Trade</strong> and photographer <strong>Malak
						Karsh</strong>.
					Ottawa became well known for its tulips so organising a festival was seen as a good idea to promote
					the city and showcase their <em>well-known</em> tulips. The most well-known visitor is <strong>Queen
						Juliana</strong> who was
					responsible for making yearly tulip donations after the war. She would attend the festival's 50th
					anniversary in 2002.
					<br><br>
					While there was a display of tulips there, concerts were also hosted but would not be given more
					emphasis until its later years. Many local bands and artists performed at the festival, including
					soon-to-be-phenomenon Alanis Morissette.
					However, not everything was a bright as the colour of the tulip. <em>Poor</em> weather and unknown
					artists
					led to <em>unstifactory</em> admission and ticket sales which resulted the festival to file for
					<strong>bankrupcy</strong> in 2006. In
					the 21st century, management was changed twice in order to adapt to the new changes.
					Despite the issues, the Canadian Tulip Festival continnued to bring new idesa to the table.

			<p>One of the ideas the festival brings is a <em>unique</em> theme. In 2007, it was <strong>"CelebrIDÉE
					A Celebration of
					Ideas"</strong>. In 2008, it was <strong>"Where Ideas Bloom"</strong>. There was even a plan to
				have an in-person event to
				celebrate 75 years since the Netherlands's liberation from Nazi Germany.
				Unfortunately, like most events in 2020, it was held virtually with aerial photographs and image
				captures being used to simulate the in-person experience. The themes provide an <em>enjoyable</em>
				experience
				and ensures originality.
				<br><br>
				The Canadian Tulip Festival continues to be an <em>extraordinary</em> festival filled with
				<em>extraordinary</em>
				surprises. It is a festival worth visiting and there are other attractions held such as a tulip
				market, play zone, and movie night.
				There is something for everyone and the festival can provide you the best posible experience. If you
				plan to visit Ottawa in May, don't forget to stop by at this festival.
