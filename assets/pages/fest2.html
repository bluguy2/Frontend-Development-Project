		<h2>Canadian Tulip Festival</h2>
		<section>

				<p>Located in Ottawa in the provence of Ontario, Canada, the Canadian Tulip Festival is claimed to be
					the world's largest tulip festival.
					Just like the Chelsea Flower Show, it is held annually in May and it attracts 650,000 visitors. The
					festival lasts for 2 days, leading up to an important Victoria Day.
					Tulips are seen throughout Ottawa with the largest display seen in Commissioners Park. The admission
					is free of charge and there are many events held to atrract many generations.
					<br>
					In addition, the festival is organised as a non-profit charity under the name, "The Canadian Tulip
					Legacy". It uses the money to continue supporting the festival and help others be educated about the
					tulips.
					The festival also has a cultural and historical aspect which makes it more unique than any other
					festival in the world. Its relationship with the Netherlands has helped create its existence but the
					story is quite interesting.
					In the next section, you will find out the origins of the festival and how the Netherlands continues
					to provide support to the festival.

				<p>Seymour Cobley first donated 83, 000 tulips to Canada during the Second World War for their
					contribution. However, it was the Dutch family who donated 100,000 tulips to the Canadians after the
					war for proctecting them from Nazi Germany.
					The contribution would eventually have a huge impact as the first Canadian Tulip Festival was
					organised by the Ottawa Board of Trade and photographer Malak Karsh.
					Ottawa became well known for its tulips so organising a festival was seen as a good idea to promote
					the city and showcase their well-known tulips. The most well-known visitor is Queen Juliana who was
					responsible for making yearly tulip donations after the war. She would attend the festival's 50th
					anniversary in 2002.
					<br><br>
					While there was a display of tulips there, concerts were also hosted but would not be given more
					emphasis until its later years. Many local band and artists performed at the festival, including
					soon-to-be-phenomenon Alanis Morissette.
					However, not everything was a bright as the colour of the tulip. Poor weather and unknown artists
					led to poor admission and ticket sales which resulted the festival to file for bankrupcy in 2006. In
					the 21st century, management was changed twice in order to adapt to the new changes.
					Despite the issues, the Canadian Tulip Festival continnued to bring new idesa to the table.

				<p>One of the ideas the festival brings is a unique theme. In 2007, it was "CelebrIDÉE A Celebration of
					Ideas". In 2008, it was "Where Ideas Bloom". There was even a plan to have an in-person event to
					celebrate 75 years since the Netherlands's liberation from Nazi Germany.
					Unfortunately, like most events in 2020, it was held virtually with ariel photographs and image
					catures being used to simulate the in-person experience. The themes provide an enjoyable experience
					and ensures originality.
					<br><br>
					The Canadian Tulip Festival continues to be an extraordinary festival filled with extraordinary
					surprises. It is a festival worth visiting and there are other attractions held such as a tulip
					market, play zone, and movie night.
					There is something for everyone and the festival can provide you the best posible experience. If you
					plan to visit Ottawa in May, don't forget to stop by at this festival.
