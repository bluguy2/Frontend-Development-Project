				<p>While it isn't exactly a festival, the Flower Carpet is a bi-annual event that is held in the Grand-Place in Brussels, Belgium. Volunteers from Belgium gather there to weave a carpet-like tapestry out of colourful begonias or dahlias.
				   The event takes place in August which lasts for 3 to 4 days. In each edition, a different theme is chosen in order to make it unique. Once completed, many citizens and tourists come to see the tapestry and appreciate the beautiful art. 
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					Unlike the festivals that are mentioned in this page, the only display available to the public is the tapestry. It is 70 m long and 24 m wide, and has an area of 1,680 m2. 
					What's more is that a hundred volunteers are involved in weaving the tapestry. The history of the Flower Carpet is quite fascinating as no art has gotten much attention as this.
					What started as an advertisement turned out to be something special for many years to come.

				<p>Etienne Stautemans, a Ghent landscape architect, first created the Flower Carpet in 1971 in a bit to promote his work. The promotion attracted a huge amount of visitors which created a tradition.
				   Tapis de Fleurs de Bruxelles, a non-profit association, was created to decide how the Flower Carpet was going to be organised in the later years.</p>

				<p>It was decided that the Flower Carpet was to be held every two years, for three to four days on the weekend of 15 August. The event could also be enhanced by providing a variety of features such as sound and lightning, concerts, and entertainment.
				   These guidlines help ensure that the carpet is ready in time and to ensure that quality remains the highest. Since 1986, the event has been held in the Gran-Place attracting between 150,000 and 200,000 visitors every two years.</p>

				<p>As previously mentioned, begonias and dahlias are used to create the Flower Carpet. Begonias provide vivid colours which enhances the beauty of the carpet. Although it takes a day to complete it, the planning of the carpet is carried out two years prior.
				   This allows the carpet to be of high quality and ensures that everything is prepared for the weaving. Next, a theme is chosen. It must be a reference to Belgian history and can be a commemoration of great events, a country, a region, or other celebrations. 
				   For example, in 2002, the carpet was reminiscent of the gardens of the Palace of Versailles.</p>

				<p>Once a theme is chosen, planning commences and decision is made on its model,  how long and wide the carpet should be, how many flowers it must be needed to produce the carpet and the size of each flower. About 100 volutneers start working on the carpet on the day of the event which lasts about 8 hours.
				   Afterwards, the public can admire the carpet for the remainder of the event. Visitors can also watch it from the balcony of the Town Hall for a small fee. However you admire it, the Flower Carpet is a beautiful sight which shouldn't go away. 
				   It continues to provide colour to the Grand-Place and Brussels during the peak of Summer due to its artsyle and charm.</p>
