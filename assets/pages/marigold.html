                <strong>The marigold</strong> is a flower known for its vibrant gold and orange tones, bringing warmth
                and <em>energy</em> to gardens and rituals.
                It’s often associated with the sun due to its bright appearance and symbolizes
                <strong>creativity</strong> and *positivity*.
                Marigolds have played important roles in <strong>cultural traditions</strong> across the world, from
                India to Latin America.
                In Day of the Dead celebrations, their scent and color guide spirits home. They are also used in
                *weddings*, garlands, and sacred offerings.
                With their ease of growth and strong aroma, <strong>marigolds</strong> are both decorative and
                <em>practical</em> in the garden.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond beauty, marigolds are valued for their <strong>medicinal</strong> and pest-repelling properties.
                They can be made into <em>infusions</em>, oils, and balms.
                The petals are sometimes edible and used to color and flavor food. *Calendula*, a close relative, is
                known for soothing skin.
                These flowers thrive in full sun and poor soil, requiring minimal care. Their presence deters insects
                and even <strong>nematodes</strong> underground.
                Marigolds bloom generously and respond well to regular trimming. They’re a symbol of <em>resilience</em>
                and cheerfulness,
                reminding us that strength and beauty often grow from <strong>humble</strong> soil.
